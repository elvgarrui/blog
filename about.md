Hi! My name is Elvira. I'm a Associate (Junior) Software engineer working at
**Red Hat**.  I'm passionate about **free software**.

I'm currently contributing to
[**Neutron**](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/), a project inside of
**Openstack** that provides Networking connectivity and implements the
Openstack Networking API. I mostly participate in issues that are related to
the Neutron OVN driver.

I've also contributed to [**Linux System
Roles**](https://linux-system-roles.github.io/) as part of the Google Summer of
Code program. My main task was to improve the Network role. The community was
welcoming and I encourage anyone who is interested on free software to take a
look at this or any other Fedora project. I learnt quite a lot, it was a great
opportunity.

Previous to that, I contributed to several research articles at the University
of Seville. You can check them on [**Google
Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=guYINIAAAAAJ&hl=en).

something wrong on my blog ðŸŒ¿
