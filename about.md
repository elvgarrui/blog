Hi! My name is Elvira. I'm a Software engineer who is currently finishing her master con Computation and AI, and who is passionate about **free software**.

I'm currently contributing to [**Linux System Roles**](https://linux-system-roles.github.io/). My main task right now is to improve the Network role.

I've contributed to several research articles at the University of Seville:
- [A general approach to Software Product Line testing.](https://biblioteca.sistedes.es/articulo/a-general-approach-to-software-product-line-testing/)
- [Data-Analytics Modeling of Electrical Impedance Measurements for Cell Culture Monitoring.](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/21/4639)
- [Variability management in a software product line unaware company: towards a real evaluation.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335058684_Variability_Management_in_a_Software_Product_Line_Unaware_Company_Towards_a_Real_Evaluation)
